# Book-Exercise-Projects

Ignore how the exercises are not in sequenced order (e.g Ex 4,5,6,7,9)

The questions are at the top of each Python exercise file commented out

These were the exercises i did when i taught myself how to code so thought i would do them again for a nostalgic feel.

I tried to use the most effective and systematic methods to achieve the solution

Hopefully this repo will help shed some more light on the types of implementation i can do with Python and how i can organise,
maintain and complete projects to the full effect and efficiently. :)
